\chapter{Probabilistic Occupancy Grid Mapping} \label{chap:pogm}

In this chapter, we present the exact solution to occupancy grid map probability. The Bayesian approach uses the stochastic properties of sensors, and exploits important patterns in conditional probabilities. This solution is simulated in several examples to show the efficacy of the approach.
