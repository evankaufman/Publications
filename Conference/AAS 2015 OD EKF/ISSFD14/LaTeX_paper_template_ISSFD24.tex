\begin{abstract}
In this paper, nonlinear observability criteria are presented for the relative orbital dynamics represented by the solutions of the two-body problem. It is assumed that a chief is on a circular orbit with a prescribed orbital radius, and it measures line-of-sight toward a deputy. A differential geometric method, based on the Lie derivatives is used to derive sufficient conditions for observability of the orbital properties of deputy. It is shown that under certain geometric conditions on the relative configuration between the chief and the deputy, the nonlinear relative motion is observable from angles-only measurements. An extended Kalman filter is also developed to numerically illustrate the observability of nonlinear relative orbits with angles-only measurements.

\section{Introduction}
Space-based surveillance or relative navigation is desirable for many spacecraft missions, such as formation control and rendezvous. Spacecraft maneuvers based only on on-board measurements reduce the total operating cost significantly, and it improves safety against communication interruptions with ground stations.  Relative navigation between spacecraft in close-proximity essentially correspond to space-based orbit determination.  In particular, vision-based navigation and estimation of relative orbit have received attention recently, since optical sensors have desirable properties of low cost and minimal maintenance, while providing accurate line-of-sight measurements.

Relative navigation based on angles-only measurements has been investigated in.  The problem is to determine the relative orbit between a chief spacecraft and a deputy spacecraft by using the line-of-sight between the two objects, as-suming that the orbit of the chief is known.  Reference 1 shows that the relative orbit is unobserv-able from angles-only measurements when linear relative orbital dynamics are assumed, unless there are thrusting maneuvers.  Reference 2 investigates observability by using a relative orbit model linearized about spherical coordinates.  Reference 3 introduces the concept of partial ob-servability to determine a basis vector representing a family of relative orbits, and an initial orbit determination technique for this method.  However, all of these results are based on linear relative orbital dynamics.

In this paper, the authors derive observability criteria for the nonlinear relative orbital dynam-ics represented by the solutions of the two-body problem.  Assuming that a chief is on a circular orbit with a prescribed orbital radius, nonlinear equations of motion for the relative orbital motion of a deputy with respect to the chief are derived.  A differential geometric method, based on the Lie derivatives of the line-of-sight from the chief to the deputy4, is applied to obtain sufficient conditions for observability.  It is shown that under certain geometric conditions on the relative configuration between the chief and the deputy, the nonlinear relative motion is observable from angles-only measurements.  We also develop an extended Kalman filter to illustrate the observa-bility properties numerically.
