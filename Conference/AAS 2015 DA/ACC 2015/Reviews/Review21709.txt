Reviewer 6 of 2015 ACC submission 1089

Comments to the author
======================

The paper is rather hard to read. There are a lot of
engineering slogans and lack of detailed problem
formulation.
The problem should be formulated better in part II. I have
a feeling that the authors are trying to say to much,
forgeting about potential readers. The problems with
uncertainty are rather important and this is in fact the
reason I'm forward accepting (weakly) the talk. The paper
should be carefully rewritten before any publication.
