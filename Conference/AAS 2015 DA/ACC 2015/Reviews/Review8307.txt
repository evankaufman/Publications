Reviewer 3 of 2015 ACC submission 1089

Comments to the author
======================

I am not quite certain whether this paper fits within the
profile of this conference. The contribution of the paper
is not clear to me. What's proposed is probably useful from
a target tracking application viewpoint, but all the
calculations are pretty much straightforward and the ideas
behind them are hardly surprising. There paper has no
rigorous statements that would challenge my mind, and the
ideas proposed are pretty much ad hock. If I were attending
the presentation, what is the main message of the paper
that I should take home?  

On the minor point, numerous abbreviations used throughout
the paper were irritating as they were forcing me to
repeatedly search through the paper to try to remember what
they mean. Another point (perhaps not so minor) is
concerned with the terminology. I don't get why the paper
talks about minimum uncertainty - you minimize a posteriori
covariance, not the uncertainty. Also, you should explain
if there are differences between your MUJPDA filter and the
Kalman filters with missing measurements. There have been
many results on the latter topic lately.
