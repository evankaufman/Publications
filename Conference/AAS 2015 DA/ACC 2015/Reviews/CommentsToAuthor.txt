This paper considers an estimation problem in which a known
number 
of objects in close proximity are observed but the
measurement origins 
are uncertain. The authors should clearly state the new
innovation compared with [1] as well as clarify what is a
major contribution of this paper. Many 
statements require more rigorous formulations.
