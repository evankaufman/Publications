Comments to the author
======================

The paper proposes a method for autonomous robotic
exploration with multiple robots. The authors employ an
occupancy grid map as environment's model, and they employ
a bidding-based method for multi-robot cooperation.
Moreover, the authors include a receding horizon method to
handle dynamic obstacles.

Overall the paper is well written. Moreover, I strongly
believe that the use of bidding-based methods for
multi-robot cooperation has a strong potential.

However, I've identified two major issues while reading the
paper:
- There are no references to previous work on multi-robot
exploration. I would recommend the authors the paper
"Coordination strategies for multi-robot exploration and
mapping"
(http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/02783649135153
09) for a review of the state of the art. Unfortunately,
for me as reviewer I cannot judge the paper if authors do
not explicitly mention the improvement of their method
respect to the state of the art. In addition,
state-of-the-art works should be employed as benchmark to
test the authors method.
- The paper structure is not clear. I'm missing a section
that presents an overview of the whole approach. Without
this, I was not able to fully understand the algorithm. I
had multiple unanswered questions like e.g.: when does the
bidding based cooperation takes place? Continuously?
Every-single step? How the receding horizon method works
together with the the bidding-based method? When does the
robot take measurements? A block diagram of the whole
approach would definitely help to answer all these
questions.

Appart from those issues, I would like to raise some
additional comments:
- The authors employ an uncertainty-based exploration
technique. It's not fully justified why you selected such
method. Why not for example using mutual information (MI)?.
MI, in contrast to uncertainty, is a more informative
metric. See e.g. "On mutual information-based control of
range sensing robots for mapping applications", or
"Distributed Multi-Robot Cooperation for Information
Gathering under Communication Constraints".
- The reviewer does not fully understand the use of a
receding horizon method. Although the authors justify its
use in case of dynamic obstacles, the evaluation does not
include any dynamic obstacles. It's a nice add-on, but its
use should be better justified.
- The assumptions that you consider in your work are not
completely clear. In particular, it was not clear to me the
following: do you assume a perfect robot localization? do
you consider sensor noise in your approach?
- The authors project the 3D map in a 2D map. However, they
do not comment on the implications of such projection. What
do you lose in terms of map representability, and in terms
of algorithm's performance?
- You mention in the conclusions, that your approach is
near-optimal. However, this is not justified in the paper;
neither from a theoretical nor from a heuristic
perspective. Fig. 5 could be a good indicator of the
algorithm's performance. However, in Fig. 5 we can only see
that entropy decreases but it does not go to 0. Authors
justify that this is due to the fact that there are
unreachable positions. Nevertheless, authors could
calculate entropy only at reachable positions. This way, we
should see that entropy converges to zero.

To finalize, I would like to highlight a couple of points
for improvement:
- The authors consider a centralized bidding approach. I
strongly believe that a clear next step is employing a
distributed approach. 
- The authors employ a myopic coordination approach, where
robots plan their intermediate next step. I would recommend
the authors to look at non-myopic approaches. See e.g.
"Online Information Gathering using Sampling-Based Planners
and GPs: an Information Theoretic Approach".
- In figures 3,4 I would only include a couple of snapshots
(not that many). I believe this is not needed as that
content can be better seen in the video.

In summary, I believe this paper has potential to become a
relevant contribution. Nevertheless it should be improved
to better justify the novelty and details of the proposed
approach.

Comments on the Video Demonstration
===================================

The video overall is good, as it shows the exploration run.
This gives the reader a good feeling on how robots
coordinate.

Possible improvements:
- Include a simultaneous plot showing the reduction in the
total map entropy.
- As the robots you're conside
