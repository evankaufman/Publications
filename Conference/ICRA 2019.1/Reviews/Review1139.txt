Comments to the author
======================

The following paper presents a bidding-based autonomous
exploration strategy. On it, several robots communicate
with a centralized entity that decides the next exploratory
step of each of them. To do so, the system keeps track of
the information gain that each robot can/will achieve when
moving to a specific area. This produces a behavior that
tends to distribute the robots over the full scenario,
prioritizing not visited places.
The paper also claims to handle collision avoidance over
the robots with a double system. On the one hand, a
projection of the position of the robot in the 2D plane
combined with a simple Dijkstra search avoids paths where
other robots are present. On the other hand, the predicted
decreased of interest motivated by the movement of a robot
prevents other robots to select same areas of interest.

In the first place I would like to congratulate the authors
for the nice and direct introduction, and for the review
made in the subject. The overall paper is nicely written,
and focus on a topic of interest in nowadays researches.   

However, even if I consider that the paper should be
published, there are several changes that I would strongly
recommend to do for the final version. 

Major review:

According to the contributions presented in [8][9][10] and
[18], the “single” novelty introduced on the paper is the
use of multiple robots. Such problem is big enough to
justify the novelty of the paper, but there are some lacks
that seems to be addressed, but that are not mentioned:
 
- It would be nice to know the algorithm that is used to
generate the map in figure 3. If someone wants to reproduce
this work, this information is crucial. Moreover, it will
provide me a better understanding as a reader of how
positions of the robots are handled. 
- The way that the positioning of the robots in the
environment is not clear in the paper. In figure 3 (b) the
three robots start in independent positions but the
authority that decides where to send them seems to know
where are they in all moment. A deeper clarification on
that direction is necessary in the paper.
- I think that I missed the uncertainty on the positioning
of the robot itself while computing new predictions. Sensor
measurements are assumed to be noisy, meaning that the
localization on the map should be noisy as well right?
- Collision avoidance with Dijkstra is addressed in 2d,
while robots could use the third dimension to avoid
themselves. This can be easily fixed mentioning the problem
of the washdown effect that a quadcopter has when passing
under an other. A simple mentioning of that justifies the
use of a simple 2D.
- “The robot with the largest bid wins the first auction at
index k*”. Is hard for the reader to guess where k* is. Is
around the robot? Is far away in an unvisited corner? Could
you provide an example on your paper? 

Minor review:
- Formula (1) is really necessary?
- “IV Numerical results” is meant to explain the results of
the experiments. Before, it would be great to have an
“Implementation” section where the discussion of how the
algorithm is behaving in different threads/different nodes
is done.

Not really a comment but weird: 
- Why the paper has 7,5 pages?	

Comments on the Video Demonstration
===================================

The places of the robots in the video is not fully visible.
There are supposed to be 3 robots, but I am only able to
see the places of two of them and just at some times.
