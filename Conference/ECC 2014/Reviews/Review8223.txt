Comments to the author
======================

The lack of a proper comparison to state-of-the-art
algorithms makes this paper unacceptable.

You have also forgotten to take units into account in your
formulation. In equation 19 it is not possible to take the
trace of a covariance matrix with components of different
physical dimension. In equation 18 JP will have some
physical dimension, but c*JS is a dimensionless quantity.
